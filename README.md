# go-design-patterns

## Overview

`go-design-patterns` is a collection of design patterns implemented in the Go programming language. This repository serves as a reference for learning and understanding various design patterns by providing:
- Clear and concise implementations.
- Explanations and use cases for each pattern.
- Test cases to demonstrate practical usage.

## Structure
The repository is organized into categories of design patterns:
1. **Creational Patterns**: Patterns for object creation.
2. **Structural Patterns**: Patterns for composing objects and classes.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Patterns for communication between objects.
4. **Concurrency Patterns**: Go-specific patterns for managing concurrency.

Each pattern has its own folder with:
- An implementation in Go (`*.go` files).
- Tests to validate the pattern's behavior (`*_test.go` files).
- A `README.md` explaining the pattern, its use cases, and implementation details.
